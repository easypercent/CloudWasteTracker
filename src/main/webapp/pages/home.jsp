<h1>Project description:
</h1>
<p>
Managing an enterprise public cloud account in a financially accountable way can be a challenge as environments scale.  
This project would develop a solution that would identify resources that are materially underutilized, track them over time and create alerts and reports to track the amount of potential wasted spend the resource is generating.
The goal of this would be to promote the visibility of underutilized resources that generate spend and promote efficiency opportunities.
